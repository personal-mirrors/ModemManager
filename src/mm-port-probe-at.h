/* The response processor. The expected result depends on the
 * probing type:
 *  - AT             --> Boolean
 *  - Vendor         --> String
 *  - Product        --> String
 *
 * TRUE must be returned when the operation is to be considered successful,
 * and a result may be given.
 *
 * FALSE must be returned when:
 *  - A GError is propagated into result_error, which will be treated as a
 *    critical error and therefore the operation will be aborted.
 *  - When no result_error is given, to instruct the operation to go on with
 *    the next scheduled command.
 *
 * A special case to consider is the initialization commands, used by
 * some plugins. In this case, there is no expected result, but plugins may
 * set an optional boolean result, specifying whether the port is an AT port
 * or not.
 *  - Initialization --> None or Boolean
 * When the initialization is considered enough, TRUE is returned, and
 * FALSE otherwise.
