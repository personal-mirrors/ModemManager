ModemManager 1.6.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib 2.36.0
   ** gettext 0.19.3
   ** libmbim >= 1.14.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.16.0 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 or libsystemd-login >= 183 (for the optional suspend
      and resume support)

 * For distributions using systemd, it is suggested that the new optional
   suspend/resume is explicitly requested during configure with the new
   '--with-suspend-resume=systemd' argument.

This version comes with the following new features:

 * Core:
   ** Implemented support for suspend/resume detection, currently working
      when systemd is in use. Whenever the system is suspended, we'll flag the
      modems as invalid so that they are re-probed from scratch when the system
      is resumed.
   ** Added cancellation support for the probing operations.
   ** Reworked and simplified the serial port response processing.

 * Location interface:
   ** Added A-GPS support, currently available only for QMI based modems with
      PDS service.
   ** Added support for updating the default GPS refresh time.

 * Time interface:
   ** New default implementation for all AT-based modems.

 * Voice interface:
   ** New DBus interface to allow the management of voice calls, which currently
      assumes that the audio channel is setup out of ModemManager.

 * Bearer:
   ** New support for reporting statistics of the ongoing connection with a new
      'Stats' property, currently available for QMI and MBIM based modems.

 * QMI:
   ** Implemented support for devices which only work in "raw IP" mode, like
      the Sierra MC7455.
   ** Implemented support for SIM related operations using the UIM service, as
      newer modems with multi-SIM capabilities don't suppor the legacy DMS UIM
      operations.
   ** Implemented support for detecting network-initiated disconnections.

 * MBIM:
   ** If online mode fails, try to use the 'DMS Set FCC Authentication' QMI
      message via the QMI-over-MBIM support, if supported by the device.

 * udev:
   ** Added new supported 'ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE' tag to allow fully ignoring ports
      specified by the user.

 * mmcli:
   ** Added command completion.
   ** Added new operations to use the Voice interface.
   ** Added new operations to manage the A-GPS settings.

 * Build:
   ** Added code coverage support.

 * Plugins:
   ** haier: new plugin to support the Haier CE81B.
   ** thuraya: new plugin for Thuraya satellite modems.
   ** sierra-legacy,sierra: the implementation for Sierra modems is now split
      into two different plugins: a 'legacy' one for the old PPP and DirectIP
      based modems and the standard one for the newer QMI and MBIM based ones.
   ** dell: new plugin for Dell rebranded devices from Novatel, Sierra or
      Ericsson.
   ** gobi: removed the plugin. All non-vendor specific QMI devices should now
      be managed by the generic plugin.
   ** mbm: dynamically load the list of supported modes.
   ** mbm: fixed several connection/disconnection issues.
   ** simtech: support QMI devices.
   ** huawei: implemented Voice call management support.
   ** huawei: use static IP addressing in NDISDUP capable devices if the AT^DHCP
      response provides the IP details.

The following features which were backported to 1.4.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.6.0:

 * MBIM:
   ** The mbim-proxy is used by default.
   ** Implemented support for disconnection status notification while connected.
   ** Disabled CDMA capabilities, until properly supported.

 * QMI:
   ** The qmi-proxy is used by default.
   ** If online mode fails, use 'DMS Set FCC Authentication', required by some
      rebranded Sierra modems (e.g. Dell branded ones).
   ** Implemented support for loading SIM operator id and name.
   ** Implemented power-cycle reset functionality.

 * Plugins:
   ** telit: added support for new devices, like HE910, UE910 and UL865.
   ** telit: implemented dynamic port identification.
   ** telit: implemented unlock retries loading.
   ** telit: implemented supported/current bands management.
   ** telit: implemented supported/current modes management.
   ** telit: implemented modem reset and power down.
   ** mbm: implemented GPS support for Ericsson HS2350 and H5321gw modems.


ModemManager 1.4.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires libmbim >= 1.10.0.

This version comes with the following updates in the interfaces:

 * Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in the Bearer:
   ** Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that SLAAC should
      be used to retrieve correct addressing and routing details.
   ** DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static IP address, as
      IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local address to be present.
   ** MTU is now also included in the IP configuration properties, if specified
      by the modem, and applicable to both DHCP and STATIC methods.
 * New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem device. After
   setting the modem in this state, no further use of it can be done. Currently
   available in Wavecom and Cinterion.
 * Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows to start/stop
   the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the location information retrieval
   to other processes. Currently available in modems with independent GPS TTYs,
   like Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
 * New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for internal system tests.

Other notable changes include:
 * MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
 * Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
 * Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
 * Huawei: implemented GPS support.
 * Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
 * Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
 * Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
 * Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
 * Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't need full reset.
 * Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing test-driven
   virtual ports and system tests run during 'make check'. This new feature also
   comes with a new internal 'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*]
   options in the ModemManager program.
 * and many more fixes...
