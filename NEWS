ModemManager 1.4.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires libmbim >= 1.10.0.

This version comes with the following updates in the interfaces:

 * Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in the Bearer:
   ** Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that SLAAC should
      be used to retrieve correct addressing and routing details.
   ** DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static IP address, as
      IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local address to be present.
   ** MTU is now also included in the IP configuration properties, if specified
      by the modem, and applicable to both DHCP and STATIC methods.
 * New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem device. After
   setting the modem in this state, no further use of it can be done. Currently
   available in Wavecom and Cinterion.
 * Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows to start/stop
   the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the location information retrieval
   to other processes. Currently available in modems with independent GPS TTYs,
   like Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
 * New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for internal system tests.

Other notable changes include:
 * MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
 * Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
 * Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
 * Huawei: implemented GPS support.
 * Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
 * Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
 * Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
 * Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
 * Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't need full reset.
 * Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing test-driven
   virtual ports and system tests run during 'make check'. This new feature also
   comes with a new internal 'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*]
   options in the ModemManager program.
 * and many more fixes...
